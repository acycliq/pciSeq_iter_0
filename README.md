### Intro

Here is a more in-depth look at the first iteration of pciSeq, focusing on a specific cell classified as Zero class despite having an apparently sufficient number of gene counts. We've selected this cell for analysis because its relative isolation minimizes potential interference from neighboring cells, simplifying the examination of its characteristics.
